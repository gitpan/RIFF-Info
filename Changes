Revision history for Perl extension RIFF::Info.

1.06  Added afrequency() method for retrieving audio channel sampling rate
      information (Corren Vorwerk)
      No longer using warnings.pm because of problems with ActiveState Perl
      (Alex Polomski)
1.05  Added duration() method that was missing
      arate() now returns audio bitrate, it was giving samplerate before
      Internal method closures dropped.  Now depend on Video::Info.
      Added fourcc() method for determining RIFF fourcc value.

1.04  Moved audio codec methods to Video::Info

1.03  Minor internal changes.  No API changes.

1.02  Moving to a more standard API.  Arguments to the constructor
      must now be labeled, i.e.
      new(-file=>$filename,-headersize=>$headersize);
